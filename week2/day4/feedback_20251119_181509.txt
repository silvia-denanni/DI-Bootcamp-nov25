suggestions for improvement:
- In Exercise 1, the `lower` method is called incorrectly. It should be `sentence = " ".join(chosen_words).lower()` instead of `sentence = " ".join(chosen_words).lower()`.
- In Exercise 2, there's a typo in the key "birth_date" when adding it to the dictionary (bith_date). This should be corrected to "birth_date".
- In Exercise 2, the file path concatenation `dir_path + '\my_XPfile.json'` might not work correctly on all operating systems. It's better to use `os.path.join(dir_path, 'my_XPfile.json')` for cross-platform compatibility.
- In Exercise 2, the code attempts to load the json file in read mode right after it was created. This is unnecessary and does not seem to serve a purpose.
Brief justification:
- correctness: The code correctly implements the functionality described in both exercises, with minor errors. Exercise 1 generates random sentences as requested. Exercise 2 correctly parses the JSON, accesses the nested key, adds a new key, and saves the modified JSON to a file. The issues are mainly typos or small errors in implementation, not fundamental misunderstandings of the concepts.
- readability: The code is generally readable with meaningful variable names and comments. However, some improvements could be made, such as removing unnecessary print statements and ensuring consistent code formatting.
- performance: The code has good performance for the given tasks. The functions are relatively efficient and do not have any obvious performance bottlenecks.
- security: The code does not have any obvious security vulnerabilities. The user input in Exercise 1 is validated, which helps prevent some potential issues. There are no external calls or inclusion of untrusted data beyond the provided JSON, so injection attacks are not relevant here. The use of `os.path.join` to build file paths is a good practice that improves portability.
