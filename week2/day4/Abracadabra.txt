Abra-ca-dabra
Abracadabra
Abra-ca-dabra
Abracadabra

Pay the toll to the angels
Drawing circles in the clouds
Keep your mind on the distance
When the devil turns around

Hold me in your heart tonight
In the magic of the dark moonlight
Save me from this empty fight
In the game of life

Like a poem said by a lady in red
You hear the last few words of your life
With a haunting dance, now you're both in a trance
It's time to cast your spell on the night

Abracadabra
Amor oo na na
Abra ca da bra
Morta oo gaga
Abracadabra
Abra oo na na
In her tongue she said
Death or love tonight

Abra-ca-dabra
Abracadabra
Abra-ca-dabra
Abracadabra
Feel the beat under your feet
The floor's on fire
Abra-ca-dabra
Abracadabra

Choose the road
On the west side
As the dust flies
Watch it burn
Don't waste time on a feeling
Use your passion
No return

Hold me in your heart tonight
In the magic of the dark moonlight
Save me from this empty fight
In the game of life

Like a poem said by a lady in red
You hear the last few words of your life
With a haunting dance, now you're both in a trance
It's time to cast your spell on the night

Abracadabra
Amor oo na na
Abra ca da bra
Morta oo gaga
Abracadabra
Abra oo na na
In her tongue she said
Death or love tonight

Abra-ca-dabra
Abracadabra
Abra-ca-dabra
Abracadabra
Feel the beat under your feet
The floor's on fire
Abra-ca-dabra
Abracadabra

Phantom of the dance floor
Come to me
Sing for me a sinful melody
Ah ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah

Abracadabra
Amor oo na na
Abra ca da bra
Morta oo gaga
Abracadabra
Abra oo na na
In her tongue she said
Death or love tonight
